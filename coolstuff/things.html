<p>A list of the hardware, software, and other things I use.

<h3>Software</h3>
<p><strong>Operating System</strong><br />
I prefer Linux since it's customizable, provides a convenient way of installing programs (packages), runs well on older hardware, and doesn't "phone home" with telemetry info. Specifically, I use Debian since its mature release cycle alleviates the instability of other distros, thus requiring little maintenance. As a side-note, I keep seeing developers who treat their ignorance of Linux as a badge of honor, as if they're combatting the "mean" Linux "community". A majority of these people install a GUI-heavy Distro like Ubuntu, freeze up when forced to use the terminal, and promptly write off the entire project since it can't natively run their epic games/Adobe apps. Obviously Linux isn't for everyone, but it figures someone who writes software for a living would at least want to learn about it.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Window Manager</strong><br />
DWM was the first tiling window manager I used, but I switched to SpectrWM since it supported proper config files. Other than that, it's the same thing. I also use Conky as a status bar, and rofi instead of dmenu.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Terminal Emulator</strong><br />
I use urxvt since it's relatively lightweight, less messy than xterm, and does transparency. If only it supported sixel... guess I'll view thumbnails with feh forever.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Shell</strong><br />
I've always known that Zsh is the best Linux shell, but hadn't bothered switching to and configuring it until this summer and yeah, it's great. Powerful command completion, Vim mode, and an expansive plugin library make it leagues better than Bash (or the non POSIX-compliant FISH). At the time of writing, I'm using it with the Vim cursor, Fast Syntax Highlighting, and bd plugins- none of that bloated oh-my-zsh nonsense. Just know that the default settings are terrible, so writing a proper config file is essential.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Text Editor</strong><br />
My relationship with Vim is similar to that with Zsh; I knew it was the best option, but didn't feel like learning how to use it. For text editing, I bounced between VS Code, Google Docs, and GNU Nano. At the same time I switched to Zsh, I decided to uninstall the aforementioned programs and solely rely on Vim (technically Neovim). Though relatively inexperienced, it's already imprinted strongly on me. Command-based modal editing is so efficient that I can't go back to anything else. When school comes around, I plan on using LaTeX within vim for document-creation, and moving all my files to a home server. Oh, and I'm using the following stand-alone plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugged: Plugin manager</li>
<li>Vim-Airline: Improved status bar</li>
<li>Commentary: Line/selection commenting</li>
<li>Vim-Rainbow: Bracket highlighting</li>
<li>Nvim-cmp: Auto-suggestions
<br><br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>File Manager</strong><br />
I don't like GUI/TUI file managers, preferring to use cd/ls on the command line. I get why others like them, but they've always felt unnecessary to me. 
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Web Browser</strong><br />
Vivaldi is the best browser, and more people should be using it. Yeah, it's Chromium-based, but that makes it compatible with basically all websites and plugins. It has an extensive library of settings, many of which (no address bar, tabs on side) have become a necessity for me. It also comes with an excellent ad/tracker blocker, email client, scheduler, and online sync function, all of which can be disabled if you'd like.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Media Players</strong><br />
I previously used VLC for offline media, but recently switched to the leaner mpv. Works great, no complaints. I've also switched to ncspot (tui) over the official Spotify client since it's less resource-hungry.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Package Managers</strong><br />
I like apt, it's nice. I'm sure I'd warm up to pacman's syntax after a while, but those of apt make more sense to me. By the way, you should be using "apt" over "apt-get" since the former has a status bar. I also use Flatpak for bloated GUI apps like Steam and Signal I don't want defiling my install with GNOME and KDE dependencies.
<br><br></p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p><strong>Computers</strong><br />
My main computer is a ThinkPad P51, which I wrote about <a href="/coolstuff/computers.html">here</a>. It's a great machine; powerful CPU and GPU, excellent keyboard, lots of expandability, very durable, decent Linux compatibility, great thermals, and surprisingly acceptable battery life with tlp. It was also only $50, which is basically robbery. I got a dock for it, which is plugged into a monitor and other desktop peripherals at my desk. I also have a desktop which, despite being more powerful, has been superseded by the ThinkPad. Maybe I'll turn it into a server one of these days.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Peripherals</strong><br />
I use an SK-8845 UltraNav keyboard since it has the same layout as the one in my old T530, and comes with a TrackPoint. It's decent, though the shift key is flaky and the TrackPoint is too slow. I also switched from optical mice that wrecked my wrist to a Kensington Orbit Trackball, which has been great. Unlike other finger-operated trackballs, it includes a (very useful) scroll ring, and pressing both mouse keys middle-clicks. Static friction makes it less precise than an optical mouse, but I just use the TrackPoint when that's an issue.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Devices</strong><br />
I think the modern fixation with cell phones is stupid, but I do own an iPhone SE 3 for practical purposes. It's small, well built, and seems to have great performance. Most of the time, though, it sits on my desk in a dead/dying state with the ringer turned off. If I were to look at my most-used applications, the top three would probably be "Phone", "Messages", and "Signal". I guess that says a lot. I also own an iPad 9 which I use extensively at school, though not much outside it. "But Apple devices are all locked down and stuff, dude!", you say. I don't use mobile devices frequently/in a serious enough capacity to bother customizing them as I would my laptop.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Epic Gaming Machines</strong><br />
I don't really play video games, but I have a small collection of SNES and GameCube stuff. The former is mostly shelf decoration, though the latter gets used through my Sony CRT whenever friends are over. When I do play games, they're usually complex open-source simulators/rogue-likes such as OpenTTD, CDDA, and DCSS.</p></p><br><br><hr>
