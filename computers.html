	            <p>I've used a lot of computers over the years. This page details the most memorable ones.</p>

	        <h3>My computers</h3>
	        <b><b>"Lightbox" - My current build:</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2018 - Present<br>
			CPU: Intel i7 8700k<br>
			GPU: GTX 1060<br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 16gb 3200mhz DDR4<br>
			SSD: 500gb Samsung NVME<br>
			HDD: 1TB WD Black, 1TB WD Blue<br>
			Case: NZXT S340 Elite Mid-Tower ATX<br>
			Notes: PSU and GPU were recycled from Voyager 2.0. I got to build this as a present for graduating middle school. It was a beast then, and is still a beast now.</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>"Voyager 2.0":</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2016 - 2018<br>
			CPU: Intel i5 4690<br>
			GPU: GTX 750ti/1060<br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 16gb 1600mhz DDR3<br>
			SSD: 120gb PNY, 240gb PNY, 80gb Intel<br>
			HDD: 1TB WD Blue<br>
			Case: Corsair 300R Mid-Tower ATX<br>
			Notes: This wasn't exactly a distinct build per se, but rather a "Computer of Theseus". As I gradually replaced the lesser parts from the original build with better ones, it reached a point where it was practically a whole new computer. When I upgraded, I gave it to my dad.</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>"Voyager":</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2015 - 2016<br>
			CPU: Intel i5 4690<br>
			GPU: GTX 750ti<br>
			RAM: Single-Channel, 8gb 1600mhz DDR3<br>
			SSD: None <br>
			HDD: 1TB WD Blue<br>
			Case: Old Dell Dimension Mid-Tower mATX<br>
			Notes: I bought most of the parts over the latter half of 2015. I didn't have any money for a GPU, so I just used integrated graphics for the first couple months of owning it. I was obsessed with the Voyager probes for some reason, so I painted the case black and white, and taped on a golden CD (the golden record).</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>13" Unibody Macbook Pro:</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2012 - Present<br>
			CPU: Intel i5 3210M<br>
			GPU: Intel HD 4000<br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 16gb 1600mhz DDR3L<br>
			SSD: 240gb Sandisk<br>
			HDD: None<br>
			Case: 13" Unibody Chassis<br>
			Notes: This thing was my first personal computer; I got it for my 9th birthday. It's still my main laptop, and has proven to be one of the most dependable pieces of technology I've ever owned. It ran Windows for a while, but I've since upgraded it to macOS Big Sur (which is apparently "unsupported"- yet it runs flawlessly with OCLP :-) )</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>2011 Family PC build:</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2011 - 2015<br>
			CPU: Intel i5 2600k<br>
			GPU: GT 440/750ti <br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 8gb 1300mhz DDR3<br>
			SSD: None <br>
			HDD: 500gb WD Green, 250gb segate<br>
			Case: Unbranded 90s beige Mid-Tower ATX<br>
			Notes: Used to be the family PC before it was replaced by an old iMac, and becoming my dad's computer. It became my mom's computer after I gave my dad "Voyager 2.0".</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>2006 Family PC build:</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2006 - 2011<br>
			PU: Intel Pentium 4<br>
			GPU:Unknown XFX ATI Card<br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 2gb 800mhz DDR2<br>
			SSD: None<br>
			HDD: 250gb WD Caviar Blue<br>
			Case: Unbranded 90s beige Mid-Tower ATX<br>
			Notes: Was used up until 2011, when it quit working. It ran Windows XP and, for a while, was hooked up to a bulky CRT monitor. The case was recycled for the 2011 build.</p>
			<br>
