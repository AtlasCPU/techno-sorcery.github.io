	        <h3>My computers</h3>
		        
			<b><b>"Lightbox" - My current build:</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2018 - Present<br>
			CPU: Intel i7 8700k<br>
			GPU: GTX 1060, 6GB<br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 16gb 3600mhz DDR4<br>
			SSD: 500gb Samsung NVME<br>
			HDD: 4TB WD Red Plus<br>
			Case: NZXT H510 Flow Mid-Tower ATX<br>
			Notes: PSU and GPU were recycled from Voyager 2.0. I got to build this as a present for graduating middle school. It was a beast then, and is still a beast now. Only real upgrades were a 4TB HDD for all my <i>obtained</i> files, and a new case because 15 year-old me didn't know how to treat my S340 Elite.</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>"Voyager 2.0":</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2016 - 2018 (main), 2018 - Presenta<br>
			CPU: Intel i5 4690<br>
			GPU: GTX 750ti (formerly), GTX 1060, 6GB<br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 16gb 1600mhz DDR3<br>
			SSD: 120gb PNY, 240gb PNY, 80gb Intel<br>
			HDD: 1TB WD Blue<br>
			Case: Corsair 300R Mid-Tower ATX<br>
			Notes: This wasn't exactly a distinct build per se, but rather a "Computer of Theseus". As I gradually replaced Voyager's original parts, it reached a point where it was practically a new computer. When I upgraded, I gave it to my dad.</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>"Voyager":</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2015 - 2016<br>
			CPU: Intel i5 4690<br>
			GPU: GTX 750ti<br>
			RAM: Single-Channel, 8gb 1600mhz DDR3<br>
			SSD: None <br>
			HDD: 1TB WD Blue<br>
			Case: Old Dell Dimension Mid-Tower mATX<br>
			Notes: I bought most of the parts over the latter half of 2015. I didn't have any money for a GPU, so I just used integrated graphics for the first couple months of owning it. I was obsessed with the Voyager probes for some reason, so I painted the case black and white, and taped on a golden CD (the golden record).</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>13" Unibody Macbook Pro:</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2012 - 2022<br>
			CPU: Intel i5 3210M<br>
			GPU: Intel HD 4000<br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 16gb 1600mhz DDR3L<br>
			SSD: 240gb Sandisk<br>
			HDD: None<br>
			Case: 13" Unibody Chassis<br>
			Notes: This thing was my first computer; received as a 9th birthday present. It proved to be very dependable during an entire decade of service, only showing age at the very end.</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>2011 Family PC build:</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2011 - 2015 (main), 2015-2022<br>
			CPU: Intel i5 2600k<br>
			GPU: GT 440 (formerly), None<br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 8gb 1300mhz DDR3<br>
			SSD: None <br>
			HDD: 500gb WD Green, 250gb segate<br>
			Case: Unbranded 90s beige Mid-Tower ATX<br>
			Notes: Used to be the family PC before it was replaced by an old iMac. It was my dad's computer for a while, before being passed to my mom and finally finding its way into my closet.</p>
			<br>
			<b><b>2006 Family PC build:</b></b><br>
			<p>Years: 2006 - 2011<br>
			PU: Intel Pentium 4<br>
			GPU:Unknown XFX ATI Card<br>
			RAM: Dual-Channel, 2gb 800mhz DDR2<br>
			SSD: None<br>
			HDD: 250gb WD Caviar Blue<br>
			Case: Unbranded 90s beige Mid-Tower ATX<br>
			Notes: Was used up until 2011, when it quit working. It ran Windows XP and, for a while, was hooked up to a bulky CRT monitor. The case was recycled for the 2011 build.</p>
