			<p><strong>Moving up - 9/19/2022</strong><br>
			I've barely touched this page since its addition, something I'd like to rectify right now. In lieu of my recent move to college, I've taken the time to update some of this site's content. Having sat in an outdated and incomplete state since I graduated HS in June, a cleanup was undeniably in order.<br><br>
			A lot of things, like the about page, were spruced up a bit. Most of the pages also now have a time stamp in the header, indicating when they were last updated.

	        <p><strong>Getting up to date - 3/6/2022</strong><br>
	        Hello, and welcome to techno-sorcery.com. I'd like to take a quick moment to upate you on the status of this webpage, as well as its current purpose.<br><br>
	        At this moment, I'm basically done with implementing the site's basic outline-- there'll be an "academics" page for me to post study guides, a "projects" page for me to act as a portfolio of my most notable work, a "cool stuff" page for me to post...  cool stuff (whoa), a "ramblings" page to act as a dumping ground for blog posts, reviews, and opinions, and a "news" page, which you're looking at right now.<br><br>
	        I intend for this place to serve as a portfolio of all the cool things I've worked on, as well as platform to share whatever I want with the entire internet. I also just wanted a cool website to show off to my friends :). For those of you who remember Ivan's World, I guess you could say it's like a more mature version of that.<br><br>
	        Speaking of Ivan's World, I think I'm gonna set it to automatically redirect here. Don't worry, though. I made sure to transfer any materials worth keeping to this site. Yes Dr. Llamas, you can still keep all those Ivan's World magnets up on your whiteboard.<br><br>
	        So yeah, that's the current state of affairs. If you could occasioally check back on this place, I'd appreciate it. Even better, you could share it with your friends. I'll be sure to update it regularly, especially since it's not like I have much else to do.
