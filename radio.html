            <h3>Crystal Set, Mk.1</h3>
	        <p><b>About</b><br>
			This is the first crystal set I've ever built, outside of activities that came with those "200-in-1 Science Fair" kit. At the time of building, I didn't exactly know enough to create my own unique design. However, I figured it would be a perfect introduction to the
			world of radio communications. Thus, I decided to construct the project in two phases-- first, I'd make an unpowered crystal reciever. Then, I'd tack-on a simple one-transistor amplifier. 
			<br><br>
			<b>The reciever</b><br>
			For the crystal reciever, I used a modified version of rimstar's "scrap radio" design. Because I didn't have a neat-and-tidy pre-built one, I chose to ommit the variable capacitor (for the time being). Although rimstar showed how to make your own variable capacitor
			out of two towel tubes and some aluminum foil, I found his solution to be somewhat unsigntly.<br><br>

			The hardest part of the entire project was building the tuning coil. Preventing the wire from springing off or losing tension as I wound it was difficult-- I had two false-starts before I managed to nail down the technique. Although I didn't exactly pay careful attention
			to how many turns I would, I believe the primary (antenna) coil had 25 windings, and the secondary coil had 150-160 windings. As a way of tuning the radio, I sanded off some of the wire's varnish and used a custom sliding mechanism. As I slid the tuner across the coil, a
			metal nail would make contact with the bare wire, completing the circuit.<br><br>

			The first time I tested the radio, it barely worked. I could pick up some nearby Mexican station, but only very, very faintly. Obviously, this wasn't the result I desired. Thinking the simple point-to-point antenna I strung out in the backyard might not be good enough, I built
			a nifty little loop antenna. However, this failed to rectify the problem. Then, it came to me: the three-inch metal stake I was using as a grounding rod might not be good enough. I decided to clip the ground wire to a water pipe and... Aha! Problem solved.<br><br>
			<b>A simple amplifier</b><br>
			Although I was getting much louder audio than I had before, the radio was only really able to pick up super close-by signals. At the same time, through inductance, the antenna would be almost completely ineffective if not placed on a large metal object. I felt it would be in
			order to build an amplifier, something I had planned on doing from the start.<br><br>
			<img src="files/images/crystal_amp_schematic.PNG" alt="The amplifier schematic I used"><br><br>
			I decided on a relatively simple circuit from techlib.com, which only needed a single transistor. It could also be bolted on right where the earphone would have normally connected, meaning I could
			very easily add it on to the crystal reciever.<br><br>
			<img src="files/images/crystal_with_amplifier.jpg" alt="The radio, with its built-in amplifier, on display"><br><br>
			With its new amplifier, the radio was much louder-- even loud enough to distort the audio output on some stations. However, I still had the issue of selectivity, or rather a lack thereof. I couldn't just listen to one station at a time, I had to mentally sift through three or more undesired ones. It was expecially bad with the Mexican station, since the signal was so strong that it would overpower everything else.<br><br>
			<img src="files/images/crystal_slider.jpg" alt="The radio, with its built-in amplifier, on display"><br><br>
			In order to better my set's selectivity, I added a sliding "tap", similar to the ones featured on "dual-slider" crystal radios of old. This way, I could directly connect the antenna to any point on the coil, further prioritizing desired frequencies while canceling-out the others. I also did some experiments with adding a variable capacitor between my antenna, and the tap point. As the capacitor was part of a "200-in-1 Science Lab Kit" and I don't feel like canibalizing it, I'm going to order one off ebay.<br><br>
			I also cut the wooden board in half, allowing for easier transport. I'm going to repurpose the other half in the future, probably to build a short-distance AM transmitter.
