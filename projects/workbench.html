<h3>Workbench</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong>  </p>

<p>In a typical Hayden fashion, I started a big project with absolutely no planning whatsoever. I was looking for an aluminum panel at Home Depot when I saw the perfect 4' x 2' plywood sheet, and decided I needed a workbench. Rather than go home and realize I had no space for another large piece of furniture, I drew up a rough plan in my head and purchased what I thought was needed. Only while trying to stow eight 10-foot douglas fir 2x4s in my mom's car did I realize what I had gotten myself into.</p>
<p>The resulting project took around one-and-a-half months, with several breaks in-between bursts of work. However, what I ended up with was an awesome workbench, one of the few times a spontaneous project of has gone well. Oh, and I was able to fit it in my room after all.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Build process</strong>  </p>
<p><img alt="A stack of 2x4s" src="/projects/img/workbench_start.jpg" /></p>
<p>After transporting the lumber home and having it leered at by some construction workers across the street, it was time to begin. I used a handsaw to cut out two two 4' lengths of douglas fir, and four 1' 6"-ish lengths. These were screwed together to form a frame for the bench surface. The two inward beams were very important, as I wanted it to comfortably support a lot of weight. </p>

<p>It was at this point when I decided the bench needed to be lacquered and stained, the former for longevity and the latter for aesthetics. I purchased some Varathane dark walnut stain and spray-on polyurethane lacquer, and applied both to what I had already built. </p>

<p>After a brief hiatus, I cut out and mounted all four legs. The ones in front were 2' 5", as it was to be a sitting workbench for electronics work, and the ones in the back were something to the tune of 5' 6". This was done so I could eventually mount a piece of 4' x 2'-ish pegboard vertically.</p>

<p>After another hiatus due to being on vacation in Hawaii, I continued building the workbench. For stability, I added two horizontal cross-bars two the rear legs, and two more connecting them to the front. I also decided to put a 4' x 1' plywood panel atop the lower support for increased storage, and mount the pegboard I had originally wanted.</p>
