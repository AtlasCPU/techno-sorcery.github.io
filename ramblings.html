	        <p><b>High school - 3/6/2022</b><br>
	        I can't say much about high school without sounding like an angsty teenager, other than that it's a total drag, but I've come to at least somewhat appreciate its social benefits. More than anything, the whole point of it is to prepare you for adulthood by throwing you together with a bunch of conflicting personalities, and forcing you to take orders from people who you don't really like. Even if I'd rather be at home most days, I can't deny that it has taught me many (social) lessons that'll come in handy throughout the rest of my life.
