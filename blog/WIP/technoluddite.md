### You should be a techno-luddite â€” February 06, 2023
Yeah, I know "techno-luddite" sounds stupid, but it greatly describes the philosophy I've adopted as of late. 

Neo-luddites argue for a near-total rejection of technology, 

It's convenient to characterize technologies as being simple, intermediary, and complex. Attributes of these groups aren't mutually exclusive, ...

Simple technologies include things like chairs, toothbrushes, cups, and whatnot- items that can easily be made under pre-industrial conditions. It's difficult to reject simple technologies because they fulfill fundamental human needs; eg. toothbrushes exist to clean your teeth, if you don't use them your health will deteriorate. At the same time, if used correctly, simple technologies have few negative implications. It's unhealthy to sit for hours, but it's an issue with modern culture rather than one inherent to chairs- their existence carries little baggage. 

Intermediary technologies are things like bikes, stoves, and electric lighting. They can be built with traditional methods, but their manufacture is most realistic with industrial machinery. For many of them, there is little social or physical imperatives of adoption; society doesn't expect you to bike instead of walking, or walk instead of biking. Again, y

Intermediary technologies carry more implications than simple ones, but they're usually primitive in nature: "this thing could be dangerous, so be careful around it".

Complex technologies requiring substantial industrial machinery to manufacture, and strongly rely on pre-existing technological structures. Think computers, phones, televisions, and cars. 

Complex technologies aren't necessarily bad, but they have further-reaching implications than simple and intermediary technologies.

Believing new technology to be inherently beneficial is very dangerous. Even things that sound good right now could have catastrophic effects in the long-term. Take gene editing: understandably, people advocate for its use in eliminating genetic diseases. 

If allowed to progress, however, it will almost inevitably be commodified. The effects of this are clear: the creation of a super-human elite
