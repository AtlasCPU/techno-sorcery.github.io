### Revamp â€” February 01, 2023  
What you're looking at is a complete revamp of techno-sorcery.com. In all aspects, this site has been made better- better looking, better to read, better to navigate, better to work on, etc. I'd like to detail the improvements I've made, and how they were implemented..

First, I'm now using a static site generator. Not a full-blown content management system like Hugo, but my own solution- [wisPy](/projects/wispy.html). I'm not going to repeat that page here, but all it does is convert folders full of markdown documents into folders full of themed html files. This saves me a lot of time and headache, meaning I'm more motivated to work on the site. 

You should give wisPy a try. Since it only does one thing, it's a dead-simple, low-overhead way of converting a vanilla html website to use markdown content. One of my roommates recommended I pitch it to the professors at my university since lots of them have old, seldom-updated html sites..

I also modernized the theme a bit. I know it still looks old-school, but it's memorable, looks cool in my opinion, and was easy to make. Main things I did were remove the gap between the main page and sidenav, remove all element shading, and replace the 2008-era subtle backgrounds with solid colors. The orange background isn't going away, but I did desaturate it a bit as to appear less jarring.

Though it only matters to me, I reorganized the folder structure to be more logical and therefore less cluttered. Makes it less annoying to traverse, I'm happy.

Finally, I changed the site's content organization scheme. Before, there were the seldom-used "Academics" and "News" pages. "News" has since been generalized into "Blog", and "Academics" has been merged with "Cool Stuff"\.

That's all I  have to talk about. Expect more articles to be written when time permits. If you have any suggestions, my contact info is on the bottom of the "About" page. 

PS: I've added a few more articles to the "Projects" page. You should take a look at them.
