### I am selling my belongings â€” February 07, 2023  
Note: With "materialism" I am referring to it in an economic sense, not a philosophical one.

I have too much stuff lying around, contributing absolutely nothing to my life. If anything, it's burdensome.

In all my years of collecting, only now have I come to this conclusion. I used to make purchases very impulsively, justifying it as worthwhile because I was having "fun", and wasn't spending much anyway. As a result, I've ended up with a large number of things I don't use. I'd like to 

I've also realized that out of everything I own, only a limited amount gets used. I can surely say the stack of computers in my closet is of little importance, and would wager that half my wardrobe doesn't get worn.


As a rejection of materialism, I have decided to sell most of my belongings. Furthermore, I've resolved to only buy things that I absolutely need.



Materialism often results in a loss of autonomy. 

In a physical sense, having a large number of possessions is burdening. I'd like the freedom to do what I with my space. Instead, it's being used to house electronic junk. If I wanted to move somewhere else, I'd have to figure out what to do with it. All my belongings are doing is creating unnecessary liability, in opposition with autonomy.

Psychologically, materialism is indicative of an overall lack of self-control. While it's fine to keep a curated handful of hobby objects, in practice many people can't moderate themselves. 

There's naturally a lot of interplay between materialism and consumerism, given its tendency to manifest as the purchasing of consumer goods. 

Like most addictions, acquiring things isn't thought of as one until it reaches extreme levels. This doesn't make it any less of one, however. 

There's no benefit to materialist behaviors, outside of shallow social expectations. Nothing whatsoever can be derived from acquiring things for acquirement's sake, other than fleeting enjoyment.
