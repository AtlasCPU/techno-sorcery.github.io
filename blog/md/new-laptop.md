### I got a "new" laptop â€” July 24, 2023

You've heard it here lads, I've technologically progressed into the late 2010s with a "new" laptop. By that, I mean a 2017 ThinkPad P51. The T530 was still sufficient, but the P51 has fully replaced my desktop. I wasn't even looking for a new laptop; I chanced upon it at an electronic swap meet for $50, and couldn't pass it up. Specs are pretty good: i7 7820HQ, Quadro M1200 4GB, 32GB RAM (only came with 4), and 500GB NVME. The dGPU is especially welcome since it can do CAD work (and play stupid 3D games). As a side note, I've revised my position on laptop GPUs- they're still dumb *unless* there is sufficient cooling, which only workstations (aka mine) and gaming laptops (which are bad for other reasons) have.

A positive side effect of setting up the new laptop is that it has gotten me deeper into Linux. I'd intended on properly configuring my setup, but was too busy during the school year. I've set up some [Ansible-powered dotfiles](https://github.com/techno-sorcery/Dotfiles-V2) at the behest of my friends, switched from nano/vscode nonsense to neovim, patched up some nice ST/DWM builds, and mostly migrated to CLI-based tools. I tried out Arch for a few hours, but compiling from the AUR was annoying (even with yay) so I went back to Debian. I'm finally building up a system that actually works. I'll probably revisit this with more detail in the future.

I also got a new phone, an iPhone SE 3. Not very libre of me, but I was tired of cheap Motorolas with only a year of updates, and Google services in general. If I loved phones, I'd hate it. However, because I hate phones, I love it. The SE 3 is a perfectly utilitarian mobile device. Processor seems decent, screen is just big enough to be usable, and it has barely any pocket presence.

That begs the question of why I run Linux on my laptop but don't care about mobile devices. Beyond note taking on my iPad, I don't use them for serious work. Because my laptop is my primary device and gets used for actually important stuff, I find it advantageous to customize it to my needs. If I somehow got Linux onto my iPad, it wouldn't have the same utility as a 15.6" x86 laptop. If I could run VIM on my phone, I wouldn't want to. Mobile devices aren't conducive to getting work done.

As for avoiding data collection, eschewing services to avoid it is noble. My immediate concern is with people having their dopamine receptors borked by social media garbage rather than Google knowing where they shop, but both these issues feed into each other. I don't use social media or goof off with my phone to begin with, but nothing will prevent the government from obtaining my cellular information.
 
<!-- Most importantly, though, is the fact that I've obtained religious faith.. I won't say much since it's worthy of a separate post, but it came after a period of atheism spanning 12 years. As a foolish kid, I told people I wished to be "stupid like a religious person" so I could be happy. Even then, I realized the utterly dissatisfying nature of atheist philosophy- the great contradiction of deriving concrete meaning from a foundation of straw. Maybe it's just a "me problem", but I'm very skeptical of those who claim to find comfort in moral subjectivity, and their actions lacking inherent meaning. Frankly, I find it horrifying. -->

<!-- Trying to fit the metaphysical into the framework of human science is foolish in my opinion, but either way the existence/supposed non-existence of God is lacking in evidence. Assuming both are equally probable, theism makes more sense from a functional point of view since it provides people with a grand purpose, concrete set of morals, and motivation to do good beyond what they *feel* is right. Even from a secular viewpoint, you'd have to knowledge how powerful the "illusion" of these can be. I'm against the view that religion is magically responsible for most of the world's problems because, beyond the surface, it's not. Even in situations where people have committed atrocities for reasons they felt truly righteous, the basic conditions that brought them about would have existed either way. Conforming to any religion (or lack thereof) wouldn't have changed the Spaniards' lust for gold. -->

<!-- Of course, logic can't help you find God. In my case, I suppose I was around the right people at the right time. I've started analyzing scripture, something even as an atheist I wanted to do. I even started regularly attending Church during the school year. I've come to find my place in Lutheranism since they respect church tradition while simultaneously affirming salvation through faith alone, hold a reverent view of the sacraments, and perform very traditional services (pipe organ and all). I'm starting confirmation when I get back, which I've greatly been looking forward to. It's also given me a connection to my ancestors, which I've never really had. A large portion of my family is Danish and, go figure, they're all Lutheran. Even my great grandfather was a Lutheran minister in the 1920s and 1930s. -->

<!-- It's pretty funny how I jumped from talking about my computer and phone to something as deep as religion, but I guess that's how I operate. As I still have a month and a half left of summer, I plan on more actively adding things to this website. -->
