### Revamp â€” February 01, 2023  
What you're looking at is a complete redux of techno-sorcery.com. In all aspects, this site has been made better: better looking, better to read, better to navigate, better to work on, etc. I'd just like to take a moment to detail all the improvements, and how I was able to implement them.

I'll start with the most important thing first, I'm now using a static site generator. Not a full-blown content management system like Hugo, mind you, but rather my own solution- [wisPy](/projects/wispy.html). I'm not going to repeat everything on that page here, but basically all it does is convert folders full of markdown documents into folders full of themed html files. This saves me a lot of time and headache that I'd otherwise get from doing everything in html, meaning I have more motivation to write content. 

By the way, you should consider giving wisPy a try. Because it only really does one thing, it's a dead-simple, low-overhead way of converting a vanilla html website to use markdown content. One of my roommates actually recommended that I pitch it to some professors at my university, since lots of them have old sites they never update because they hate dealing with html.

I also modernized the theme a good bit. Yes, I know it still looks old-school, but that's what I want. It's memorable, looks cool in my opinion, and is easy to work on without using a bunch of libraries and other stuff. Main things I did were remove the gap between the main page and sidenav, remove all element shading, and replace the 2008-era subtle backgrounds with solid colors. No, the orange isn't going away, but I did desaturate it a bit so it's less jarring to look at.

Though it doesn't matter to anyone other than me, I reorganized the folder structure to be more logical and less cluttered. Makes it less annoying to traverse, I'm happy.

In addition, I rewrote my original content to be less terse and therefore easier to read. For some reason, high school-me wrote in really clunky, conversational prose. Now, all my writing gets to the point.

Finally, I changed the site's content organization scheme. Before, there were the seldom-used "Academics" and "News" pages. "News" has since been generalized into "Blog", and "Academics" has been merged with "Cool Stuff"\.

Anyway, that's all I  have to talk about. Expect more articles to be written over the next few weeks, when time permits. If you have any (constructive) suggestions, my contact info is on the bottom of the "About" page. As a side note, I've added a few more articles to the "Projects" page; I suggest you take a look at them.
