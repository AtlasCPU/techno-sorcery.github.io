In all fairness, it's not entirely their fault; the idea that one's value can be distilled into a numerical metric has been pushed by schools, companies, governments, and psychologists out of convenience. Hollistically analyzing someone is too expensive and time-consuming for such institutions, as is fostering genuine interests. What you end up with is aformentioned type of people; passionless, beyond a desire to one up their peers' GPAs/IQs/etc, and with an identity based on numbers and vapid consumption.
