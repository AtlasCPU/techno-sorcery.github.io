### Applets
[Elementary Automata](/coolstuff/elementary.html)  
Renders Wolfram's elementary cellular automata, of which there are 256.

### Playlists
[Classic Classical](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4gjIatZfsFxEhlnaih5mU2?si=e94790f8317d4875)  
The best of classical music (and a tad bit of ragtime). All I listened to in 10th grade.


[Prog Rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6owsn3ut8DC8nYuxFO4fcz?si=10b3392ab8314bd4)  
"Phil Collin" is the singular form of "Phil Collins". Enough said.


[Cassette Rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1moiOwMjvqgH6dKJ93Bi7G?si=2cfda481c78a4e10)  
Rock music from the 70s and 80s. You could probably find it on cassette, maybe even 8-track.


[First Wave](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2UKaXvQ0s7c37yx3FeD7s7?si=6c6b96e929214f01)  
Who needs music with soul? We've got drum machines!
