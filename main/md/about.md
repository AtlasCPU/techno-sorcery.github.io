### About me
<img style="max-height:350px" src="img/me.jpeg" alt="Photo of me wearing a suit and sunglasses at the beach.">

Hello, I'm Hayden Buscher. Welcome to my personal webpage.

I'm a second-year computer engineer at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I've always been interested in computers, having written my first program in elementary school and designed my first [processor architecture](/projects/ivaniac.html) in 10th grade. Though I came into college seeing programming as a "means to an end", I've come to strongly enjoy it and would consider myself proficient in C, C++, Python, Java, Bash, and RISC-V Assembly. My specalties include systems programming, emdedded development, FPGA development, programming language design, and processor design. 

I'd consider myself an advocate of Linux and "free and open-source software", having been involved with both for the past few years. In addition to using Linux on a daily basis, I've helped several people transition to it and set-up their own configurations. I've written a guide on doing so [here](/coolstuff/linux.html), which I suggest checking out.


Throughout my life, I've kept busy working on a variety of personal projects. Some of these include an FPGA pipelined RISC-V processor, Python macro assembler, [wooden workbench](/projects/workbench.html), [FPGA electronic Tic-Tac-Toe game](/projects/tictactoe.html), [static site generator](/projects/wispy.html), [JS Video Poker game](/entertainment/poker.html), and (of course) this website.

I'm a confirmed Lutheran, and consider my theology to be somewhere between Lutheranism, high-church Anglicanism, and Catholicism. I have a strong interest in church history and Bible scholarship, in addition to (foremost) serving my community. I also have an affinity for traditional sacred music/art, liturgy, sacramentology, and church traditions.

Music is my favorite art form, with my genres of choice being synthpop, hard rock, prog rock, funk, classical, and baroque. Makes sense, given that both my parents are involved in the music industry. Some other activities I enjoy are hiking, camping, cycling, and woodworking.

### Predicted questions (and their answers)

**How did you make this site?**  
I'm not using anything special, just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with a homemade static site generator. I desined the theme myself; no templates here. I'm hosting it on GitHub pages, and using a GoDaddy domain.
<br><br>

**What computer are you using?**  
My main computer is a 2017 ThinkPad P51 I got from a swap meet for $50. You can read about the specs [here](../coolstuff/computers.html). I've upgraded the RAM to 32GB, and installed two NVME drives (1 TB and 500 GB). I use it with a dock at my desk which is connected to three monitors, a USB ThinkPad keyboard, and a Kensington Orbit trackball.
<br><br>

**What OS do you use?**  
Debian Linux. I tried Arch for a bit, but it broke after an update and I didn't feel like babysitting it anymore. Debian mitigates that issue by simply being two years out-of-date. The regular distribution's repo doesn't get updated until the next version is fully tested, preventing random breakdowns. When I need up-to-date software, I either get it from a flatpak, use an appimage, or compile from source.
<br><br>

**What's your favorite programming language?**  
I used to use Python because I was lazy and didn't feel like learning anything else, but I've really come to love C. It's simple, easy to read and write, closely mimicks the inner-workings of a computer, and produces extremely fast executables. C++ is even better by virtue of being an extension (ish) of C with support for OOP, templates, and a variety of built-in data structures.
<br><br>

**Have you considered using [insert web framework here]?**  
In all likelihood, it's completely overkill for this website. While it might net me brownie points with web devs, I've had no trouble using vanilla html and css with a sprinkle of js- all wrapped together by a [static site generator](/projects/wispy.html).
<br><br>

**What are you from?**  
I lived the first 18 years of my life in Los Angeles, California. Not where I'd choose to live, personally, but it's not like I had any say in being born there. Everything the place had to offer was diametrically opposed to what I wanted out of life; San Luis Obispo is a definite upgrade.
<br><br>

**What happened to _____?**  
It either got removed, or reworked. Sorry.
<br><br>

**Can you add something? Can I contribute?**  
Sure, just drop me a line. My contact info is below.
