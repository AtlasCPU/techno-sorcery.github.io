### About me

Hello, I'm Hayden Buscher. Welcome to my personal webpage-turned portfolio.

I'm a second-year computer engineer at Cal Poly SLO. I've been interested in the field since high schoolâ€“ having designed my first CPU in 10th grade. It goes without saying that I enjoy learning, and spend my time reading and programming.

I've worked on a host of other projects including a JS Video Poker game, Python-based macro-assembler, DIY wooden workbench, FPGA Tic-Tac-Toe game, and (of course) this website.

I greatly enjoy music, especially that from the 70s and 80s. My favorite genres are synth-pop, post-punk, prog-rock, and hard-rock. I also like hiking, cycling, and camping.<br><br>

### Infrequently Asked Questions

**How did you make this site?**  
I'm not using anything special, just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with a homemade static site generator. My host is GitHub Pages, with a GoDaddy domain.<br><br>

**What computer are you using?**  
My main computer is a 2017 ThinkPad P51 I got from a swap meet for $50. You can read about the specs [here](../coolstuff/computers.html). I've upgraded the RAM to 32GB, and installed two NVME drives (1 TB, 500 GB). It replaced my more powerful desktop since I hate using two computers. I have a drop-in dock connected to some peripherals on my desk, but I never sit there.<br><br>

**What OS do you use?**  
Debian Linux. Tried Arch for a bit, but it broke after an update. Debian is for people who don't want to babysit their OS. The stable repo doesn't get updated until the next version is fully tested, preventing random breakdowns. When I need something up-to-date, I install a flatpak, appimage, backports package, or compile from source.<br><br>

**What's the site background from?**  
It's a wallpaper sourced from MacOS 8, desaturated to appear less jarring online. No, I'm not changing it to something you think looks better.<br><br>

**Have you ever considered using a CMS?**  
I've thought about it, but decided such a thing would be completely overkill for what I want. Also (self-plug), I'm already using [wisPy](/projects/wispy.html).<br><br>

**What happened to _____?**  
It either got removed, or reworked. Sorry.<br><br>

**Can you add something? Can I contribute?**  
Sure, just drop me a line. My contact info is below.<br><br>
